Genesis Media Project is the premier media plugin for Genesis. Currently the plugin adds video support to the Genesis Framework and includes a Video Tabber.

== Description ==

The Genesis Media Project plugin currently adds a video post type with easy to use meta fields for adding videos to your site.

Videos are imported via the WordPress oEmbed feature, or may be inserted via embed code. 

MP4 videos may also be added by inserting a URL to the hosted video and are played using the Flowplayer video player.

Unlike other video plugins, all code is validated and works correctly with WordPress scripting for maximum compatibility.

Video thumbnails are automatically pulled from several sources including

* Youtube
* Vimeo
* Dailymotion

Wmode is correctly set for videos allowing drop down menus and overlays to work correctly with the video.

This plugin requires the [Genesis Theme Framework](http://designsbynickthegeek.com/go/genesis) aff link
